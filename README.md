# task_manager_oslinux
This project is a Task Manager GUI for Linux, built with Python using Tkinter for the interface and psutil for monitoring system processes. It allows users to view, manage, and terminate running processes, similar to the Windows Task Manager. The app also tracks CPU and memory usage and logs system data for analysis.
